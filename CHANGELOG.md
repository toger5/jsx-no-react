# 1.0.0

* Added Fragment support thanks to [f107](https://github.com/f107)

This release needs extra care in the babel configuration to make Fragments work.
You need to replace `babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx` with `@babel/preset-react`.
Please check the [README](https://github.com/bitboxer/jsx-no-react/blob/main/README.md)
for details.

# 0.5.0
